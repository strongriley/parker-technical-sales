Hylok fittings are manufactured to exacting tolerances in a variety of
materials including stainless steel, steel, brass and alloys in fractional and
metric sizes. Hylok two ferrule tube fittings are fully interchangeable with
other two ferrule brands of the same design such as Swagelok, Parker-Hannifan,
Ham-Let, SSP etc. and provide a cost effective solution to liquid and gas
containment. Additionally, Hylok flare, pipe, UHP, weld, and face seal fittings
provide the same attention to tolerances, materials, design while being very
price competitive.
