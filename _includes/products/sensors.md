A wide range of instruments and switches are available from premier
manufacturers for the measurement and control of liquids and gases used in
industrial, water/waste water, food/beverage, pharmaceutical, petrochemical,
and high purity applications. Flow, level, pressure, temperature, turbidity,
and humidity can be precisely controlled. Sensors, switches, and transmitters
are manufactured in stainless steel, brass, plastic, and bronze with pipe,
flange, tube fitting, tri-clamp, and sanitary connections. Expert engineering
assistance is available to address difficult applications.
